Opus Daemoniums are items that allow a Player to activate or deactivate
Requiem's death mechanics, by respectively awakening or destroying a
Player's demon.

There are 4 variants of Opus Daemoniums: Neutral, Curse, Cure, and Banishment.

Those books can only be used while in a regular player's body, with one exception: if used while possessing a mob and after having started a curing process (with weakness potion and a golden apple), they will expedite the process and turn the player into the desired type.

In the Requiem 2.0 version (1.17 and above), the Opus Daemonium has been replaced with the [Mortician's Conversion Trade](mortician#conversion-trade).

## Variants

{: .h3-wiki}
### Neutral <img src="img/items/opus_daemonium.png" class="h3-wiki-icon">

Neutral Opus Daemoniums are the base to obtain the other variants.
Using one allows a Player to write a phrase inside it. If the phrase is
correct, the book can be signed in exchange for 5 experience levels, and
converted into one of the two variants, depending on the content
written.

### Curse <img class="h3-wiki-icon" src="img/items/opus_daemonium_curse.png">

Curse Opus Daemoniums allow a Player to wake their demon. Therefore, when
used, they activate the mod's death mechanics.

To convert a Neutral Opus Daemonium into a Curse one, one must write "Ad
vitam aeternam" inside it and sign it.

### Cure <img class="h3-wiki-icon" src="img/items/opus_daemonium_cure.png">

Cure Opus Daemoniums allow a Player to destroy their demon. Therefore,
when used, they deactivate the mod's death mechanics.

To convert a Neutral Opus Daemonium into a Cure one, one must write "Ad
vitam mortale" inside it and sign it.
