## Wiki

### Rats
Rats are small, fast and **tamable** overworld creatures found spawning in groups of up to 5 **around empty villages**.
They can be **fed with any food**, the better the food, the higher the chance of taming them.
Spawned in naturally, they will be of one of the [natural types](#Gallery/Natural-types).

*They do **not** spawn around [Abandoned/Zombie Village structures](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Village#Abandoned_villages), but around [once normal villages](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Village) whose population has disappeared.
Note that for the game to still recognize a village as such it needs to **contain beds**.*

Rats have **4 hearts of health** (8hp) and deal **half a heart of damage** (1hp).
In order to make them survivable, the light critters **do not take fall damage** or damage from **berry bushes and cacti** and, much like their real counterparts, can **hold their breath** for impressive **5 times longer** than the player.

Both wild and tamed rats will **pick up any items** lying around,
**consuming food** items to **regenerate health** when damaged according to the saturation of the food
and **drinking potions** out of pure curiosity and **without regards for negative** or even deadly **outcomes**.

#### Rats as Companions
Tamed rats behave very similarly to **tamed wolves**, following around their owner and attacking enemies.
They will also pick up and **retrieve any items lying around**, a behavior that can be toggled with the [ocarina](#Equipment/Ocarina).

Rats **can be clicked** in order to **make them sit**, stopping them from following you around or moving in general.

In combat, rats deal **comparatively little damage**, which they counter in numbers: Unlike most other entities, rats ignore invulnerability ticks on enemies, meaning **they can attack very quickly** if deployed in large numbers.

#### Breeding and Plague Rats
Tamed rats can be bred using any sort of food, producing [pet rat types](#Gallery/Pet-types) as offspring.

If two **rats with the same status effect** are bred there is a chance their **offspring is a plague rat**.
Plague rats themselves are **immune to any status effects** and **pass on their associated effect** to any **target they attack**.
If two plague rats are bred their offspring will also be a plague rat of the same type.
