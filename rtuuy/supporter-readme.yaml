    Server Rules: >
      ‚Ä¢ All discord rules apply in the Minecraft server.

      ‚Ä¢ No major griefing without permission. Minor griefing is allowed for small pranks that can be easily fixed. No griefing of natural landscapes just for the sake of griefing.

      ‚Ä¢ No major stealing. Minor stealing may be tolerated for characters who are mischief-makers, but important items must not be stolen unless intentions are to return them.

      ‚Ä¢ No stealing major items for any reason if the owner is offline.

      ‚Ä¢ No hacking or cheating of any kind. No abusing glitches or mods that give an advantage. This includes (but is not limited to) minimaps, fullbright, x-ray, and auto-clickers. If in doubt, ask RAT.

      ‚Ä¢ No using end crystal, respawn anchor, or bed explosions for PvP purposes.

      ‚Ä¢ Recordings are allowed as long as everyone involved is okay with it.

      ‚Ä¢ Ender eyes have been disabled. They can still be crafted, but they can't be thrown.

      ‚Ä¢ **Failure to follow these rules will result in revocation of your server access, even if you remain a supporter.**

      ‚Ä¢ Maid outfit: not required, but highly encouraged.
    Airship Rules: >
      ‚Ä¢ There is one airship on the SMP. It is like the one from the [expedition video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfjs0MNpf8c).

      ‚Ä¢ It is free for all, and griefing rules are largely relaxed in the airship. If you take it from someone, you may change the interior as you wish.

      ‚Ä¢ You are free to do what you want with it: fight, negotiate, trade, etc. It is yours to win just as it is to lose; think of it as a game of King of the Hill, or a territory in a faction server.
