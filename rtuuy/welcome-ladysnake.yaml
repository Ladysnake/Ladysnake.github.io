    - title: Welcome to the Ladysnake Discord server!
      description: >
        Before doing anything else, please read attentively this "read me".
        It contains most of the information you'll need for your stay, including rules,
        channel and role description. Please note that if you do not read this
        and ask a question that is answered here, you'll be redirected to this page
        and asked to read it.

- type: rules
  rules:
    Respect discord: >
      Follow Discord's [Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines) and
      [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms).
    
    Respect the moderators: >
      Please follow the spirit of the rules rather than just the actual words - act in good faith.

      If you have any questions or concerns, please contact an Admin or Moderator - they have the final say.

    Respect others: >
      Insults, slurs, and hate towards any individual or group are not tolerated.

      Your profile must not have an offensive profile picture, or an offensive name or nickname. 

      Constant antagonistic behavior is considered uncivil and therefore not accepted. Sarcasm is not a toxicity permit.

      Swearing is tolerated, but do not abuse it.

      Keep your posts PG-13. Please also avoid controversial subjects.

    Respect the server: >
      The primary language of this server is English.
      Limited moderation is available for other languages, so please refrain from using them.

      Before posting in a channel for the first time, read the channel topic.

      Using the bots in a way to do prohibited stuff for normal users is naturally prohibited.

      Promotion, advertising and Discord server invitations are forbidden, unless you are given a specific authorization by one of the moderators.
      You may post discord server invitations if prompted by another user.

      Talking in another channel to circumvent a lockdown will earn you a timeout.

    - title: Frequently Asked Questions
      fields:
        - name: What is this server? I joined from RAT's channel, is this RAT's discord?
          value: >
            Welcome to the Ladysnake Discord! Ladysnake is a modding group that makes high quality mods for Minecraft.
            RAT has a special server now, so check it out in the links below! If you're interested in RAT's content,
            join the Rattiest Gang server instead. Feel free to check what Ladysnake has to offer,
            we have quite a bit of modded content if you're into that!
        - name: Can you port X to forge, bedrock, etc. please? Backport to some other version?
          value: >
            We don't port our mods to forge, bedrock or backport them for various reasons.
            If you want to make a port of one of the Ladysnake mods yourself however feel free to contact us!
        - name: How do I install fabric mods?
          value: >
            Fabric has a [guide](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/start#tutorials) for how to get started.

            Additionally, you will need to put the [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api) in your mods folder.
        - name: Where can I find information and download links for all of the mods?
          value: >
            You can find wikis and download links for Curseforge and Modrinth on [our website](https://ladysnake.github.io).
            If you cannot find the mod, it's most likely the mod isn't released yet or won't be released.
        - name: When can we expect game-nights / RAT streams / community events?
          value: >
            Watch [RAT's Twitter](https://twitter.com/doctor4t_) and join the Rattiest Gang server for information.

      description: >
        These roles cannot be added by yourself. They require someone with power to add them.

        <@&308579843749183489>: Hopefully self-explanatory.

        <@&477604399141748746>: Moderators but with a cooler name.

        <@&824612078098317346>: Core members of Ladysnake.

        <@&825417082572242994> (and any roles that these people have which aren't ping roles):
        People who have contributed in various ways to Ladysnake mods.

        <@&831488059786002473>: Retired role for Illuminations. [Illuminations](https://ladysnake.github.io/wiki/illuminations/)
        will be included in future versions of [Effective](https://ladysnake.github.io/wiki/effective), and so this role has been
        taken out of use. Cool people still get to keep this role, until it's deleted, though.
