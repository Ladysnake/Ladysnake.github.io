**Effective**  is a client-side Fabric mod that adds  various visual and auditory effects lacking in Vanilla Minecraft 
to improve overall ambience and feel of the game.
Currently, it adds water  and lava splashes to entities falling in liquids, as well as cascade
visual and sound effects.

See also [the Illuminations documentation](illuminations) for more features that have been integrated into the mod.

*Lava Splashes have been removed in more recent versions*

#### Lapis Lazuli Block Updates

**Additional cascade effects** can be created by **updating Lapis Lazuli Blocks** near the source of a water stream (for example by moving, placing or breaking them). The effects will then appear **along the entire stream** instead of solely the end.
