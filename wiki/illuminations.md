# Illuminations

**Illuminations** is a client sided Minecraft Fabric mod that adds multiple ambient particles in order to make your world more enjoyable at night or in dark places.
This mod is compatible with the [Canvas Renderer](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/canvas-renderer).

*(All screenshots with a bloom effect were taken with Canvas Renderer installed)*

## Ambience

### Overworld

#### Fireflies

**Fireflies** are small flying insects that **come out during the night** and disappear when the sun rises. They will appear in small quantities in jungle, plains, savanna and taiga type biomes, medium quantities in forest and river type biomes and great quantity in swamp type biomes.

![Fireflies](illuminations/Fireflies.png){: .wiki}

#### Glowworms

**Glowworms** are small larvae living in **caves** by **sticking to the ceiling** that will fall down if their support block is removed. They will appear in small quantities in jungle, plains, savanna and taiga type biomes, medium quantities in forest and river type biomes and great quantity in swamp type biomes.

![Wisps](illuminations/Glowworms.png){: .wiki}

#### Glowing Plankton

**Glowing Plankton** - even though difficult to notice because of its size - can be found floating around in the **dark parts of the oceanic depths**. They appear in any ocean biome as long as the light is sufficiently low.

![Glowing Plankton](illuminations/GlowingPlankton.png){: .wiki}

#### Prismarine Crystals

These beautiful glowing shards will **spawn around sea lanterns**, with more appearing in darker areas.

![Prismarine Crystals](illuminations/PrismarineCrystals.png){: .wiki}

### Halloween Features

These spooky features only appear during the month of October by default.

#### Autumnflies

During the month of October, fireflies will adopt an orange tint instead of their regular green one.

![Autumnflies](illuminations/Autumnflies.png){: .wiki}

#### Eyes in the Dark

Also during the month of October, you may come across **glowing eyes** in **absolutely dark spots**. These eyes will disappear if you come too close or if their darkness is disturbed by a light source.

![Eyes In The Dark](illuminations/EyesInTheDark.png){: .wiki}

#### Pumpkin Spirits

These mischievous entities take the form of **small flying Jack o'Lanterns** and will act like Will o' Wisps, appearing from **Jack o'Lanterns at night!**

![Pumpkin Spirits](illuminations/PumpkinSpirits.png){: .wiki}

#### Poltergeists

These **devious flying skulls** will appear from placed **skeleton skulls** at night and may also appear when you **kill undead at night!**

![Poltergeists](illuminations/Poltergeists.png){: .wiki}

### Nether and End

#### Will o' Wisps

**Will o' Wisps** are rare small ghost-like creatures that appear in **Soul Sand Valleys**, flying through the air and phasing through Soul Sand. They also appear from **Soul Lanterns**, allowing the player to create a magical or eerie ambience by decorating their surroundings with those.

![Wisps](illuminations/Wisps.png){: .wiki}

![Wisp exiting Lantern](illuminations/WispLantern.png){: .wiki}

#### Chorus Petals

Appearing near **Chorus flowers**, these beautiful petals will twirl down to the ground, to the winds of the End, transitioning from a beautiful white to a majestic purple. The younger the flower is, the more petals will appear, and **breaking a Chorus flower** will provoke a **burst of petals** (again, the younger the flower, the more petals will burst).

![Chorus Petals](illuminations/ChorusPetals.png){: .wiki}



## Special Features

### Jeb Easter Egg Expansion

*(Requires [Satin API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/satin-api/), feature disabled with Canvas and Iris because of compatibility issues*)

Renaming any mob in the game to **jeb_** will apply a **rainbow effect** to it. This feature varies the colour values of the mobs and will work better on colourful mobs such as Creepers, Piglins and Shulkers and will barely make a difference on Skeletons or Wither Skeletons. However, even mobs with fewer colours will glow after being renamed.

## Cosmetics

In addition to the ambience changes, Illuminations also features **cosmetics**, primarily for those who **donated and contributed** to the project, with the exception of the **Pride Heart Collection** that is available for all [Accounts](https://illuminations.uuid.gg/register). Cosmetics can be switched and customised using the [Illuminations Dashboard](https://illuminations.uuid.gg/). Since Illuminations is client-side you can use these cosmetics even on servers. Other players with Illuminations will be able to see your cosmetics.

### Pride Hearts
