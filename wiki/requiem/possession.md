## Mob Attributes

After finding a new host or transforming after death, the player is forced to play as a mob. **Possessor players behave**
**very similarly to their mobs**, meaning they have both their **strengths and weaknesses**. For instance, the player's inventory size may vary depending on the possessed mob and undead mobs have a slightly better vision in the dark.

**Possessed mobs**

- Are generally **slower** than human players.
- Do **not naturally regenerate health**. Please read the [**Special item uses**](#Special-Item-Mechanics) section for information on how to heal in other ways.
- Do **not** have the strength to swing their sword in a manner to do **area damage**.
- Can **not sleep** with the **exception of Villagers, Cats and Foxes.**

**Additionally, any passive behaviour from the possessed mob will be preserved**, for example

- Endermen teleport randomly in sunlight and take damage from water and rain
- Undead mobs burn in sunlight
- Axolotls can play dead, Goats can ram mobs
- Pillagers can ride Ravagers, Zombified Piglins can ride Striders

## Mob Interactions

Even while possessing other mobs, **some aggressive mobs** might become suspicious of you and **attack you if you move too close.**

This Mechanic **can be configured using [gamerules](configuration#gamerules)**.

## Loot Mechanics

Possessed mobs also **do not receive any experience from combat** and **won't be able to obtain rare drops** 
like Spider Eyes or Blaze Rods. To bypass that problem, **Humanity I** books can be found in **Nether Fortresses**
and upgraded to **Humanity II** by a [**Mortician**](mortician#humanity-trade).

**Humanity I**-enchanted swords allow players to get the **rarer drops**, 

**Humanity II** allows for the **usual experience gain**.

## Diets

Some mobs do have a hunger bar when possessed, letting them regenerate more easily, but have some eating restrictions.

- Regular **Villagers** are vegetarian, and **cannot eat any meat**.
- **Illagers** are carnist, and can **only eat stuff with meat** in it.
- **Witches** are weirdly picky, and will **only eat stuff no one reasonable would**. Also mushrooms.
- **All the above** can also eat **baked goods** like bread and pumpkin pies.
- **Piglins** can only eat **pork** and **golden food**.

## Special Item Mechanics

Depending on the undead possessed, the player may be able to use items differently from how they would if they were human. To ensure a balanced game, these item uses have varying cooldowns.


#### Raw meat ("Zombie Snack")

**Raw meat can be eaten by Zombie players** (all sub-types included) to **regenerate health**. 
A piece of meat regenerates as much health as it would recover food for a human player.

#### Raw fish ("Drowned Delicacy")

**Raw fish can be eaten by Drowned** exclusively, and serves the same purpose raw meat does.


#### Bones ("Bony Prosthesis")

**Skeletons** (all sub-types included) can **replace their damaged bones** by new ones. To do so, just use a bone and it will **regenerate 4 health points** (2 hearts).

If **Wither Skeletons** use this practice, they will **slowly turn into regular Skeletons** and have a **1/5 chance on leaving their head** to the player when doing so. The amount of bones needed for this conversion depends on the difficulty.

#### Milk buckets ("Calcium Goodness")

**Skeletons** (all sub-types included) can **drink milk for extra bone resistance**. Drinking a milk bucket grants the player **Resistance for 30 seconds**.

#### Bows ("Skeletal Efficiency")

Using a **bow as a Skeleton** (all sub-types included) has a **chance to not consume an arrow when shooting**. This ability only applies to regular arrows. Resulting arrows are not recoverable.

#### Crossbows ("Bolt Hoarder")

Using a **crossbow as a piglin or a pillager** has a **chance to not consume ammunition when shooting**. This ability applies to all kinds of crossbow ammunition, but with a lower chance than that of Skeletal Efficiency. Resulting arrows are not recoverable.

#### Tridents ("Drowned Grip")

**Throwing a trident as a Drowned** has a **chance to keep it in hand and duplicate it**. Resulting tridents are not recoverable.

#### Water Bottles ("Witch's Brew Base")

**Witches can brew potions on the fly** by holding a water bottle. The resulting potion, produced automatically in dangerous situations, depends on the apparent danger.

#### Berries

**Foxes** can **eat berries** to **regain some health**.



### Inactive Item Mechanics

#### Ammo Generation

This ability, **not being assigned to any entity** by default, completely removes the need for ammunition.

#### ![Totem of Skeletonizations](img/totem_of_skeletonization.png)Totem of Skeletonization

This variant of the Totem of Undying will **revive you as a Skeleton** once you die.
It must be held just like the Totem of Undying and works independent of hosts.

**The Totem of Skeletonization is currently unobtainable**.
