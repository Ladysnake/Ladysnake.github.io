# Soul Effects

Soul effects are special status effects that are **bound to your very self**.
They are **kept with you when leaving a body**, and **cannot be cleared through normal means**.

The Emancipation Soul Effect is the key to the Requiem gameplay as it allows remnant players to **leave their body without having to die**, avoiding Attrition and an unnecessary loss of hosts.
While under this Effect, players can use the Dissociation key to leave any mob they are possessing, if used to dissociate as a regular player, you will **leave behind a player shell**.

Reclamation lets you **slowly cure Attrition** without having to change bodies.
Each time the effect's timer runs out, the level of Reclamation is subtracted from the level of Attrition.

For example, if a level 2 Reclamation effect runs out, your Attrition level will decrease by 2 levels.

Penance is an effect that brings your **soul away from the physical plane**.
At **level I**, it **prevents** you from **curing yourself**.
At **level II**, it also **separates** you from your **human shell**.
At **level III**, it **prevents** you from getting a **physical body entirely**.

## ![Attrition Icon](img/attrition.png)Attrition

Attrition is primarily gained through the **deaths of your bodies**. As your ethereal self gets afflicted
with stronger attrition, your **hosts will become weaker and weaker**, as each level will decrease your host's health by 20%, **capped at level IV** with an 80% decrease in health. Attrition does not run out in mob hosts. Instead, to get rid of Attrition you can either get yourself a **player body and wait for the effect to run out** or use the **Reclamation Soul Effect**.

### Hardcore Mode

In order to keep the Hardcore Mode challenging **Attrition increases twice as quickly** as usual, for example going from level 0 directly to level II. In addition to that, **dying with a host under the Attrition IV effect** will make you **lose your world**. Good luck!
