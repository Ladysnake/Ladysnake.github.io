{: .section-description}
Opus Daemoniums are items that allow a Player to activate or deactivate
Requiem's death mechanics, by respectively awakening or destroying a
Player's demon.

{: .section-description}
There are 4 variants of Opus Daemoniums: Neutral, Curse, Cure, and Banishment.

Those books can only be used while in a regular player's body, with one exception: if used while possessing a mob and after having started a curing process (with weakness potion and a golden apple), they will expedite the process and turn the player into the desired type.

## Variants

{: .h3-wiki}
### Neutral <img src="img/items/opus_daemonium.png" class="h3-wiki-icon">

{: .section-description}
Neutral Opus Daemoniums are the base to obtain the other variants.
Using one allows a Player to write a phrase inside it. If the phrase is
correct, the book can be signed in exchange of 5 experience levels, and
converted into one of the two variants, depending on the content
written.
