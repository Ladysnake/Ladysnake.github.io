# Soul Vessels

## ![Shattered Soul Vessel](img/shattered_soul_vessel.png)Shattered Soul Vessel 

Shattered Soul Vessels can be found with a 20% chance (with an additional 10% per fortune level) by mining **[Derelict Tachylite](obelisks#derelict-tachylite)**. Despite not being useful on their own, they can be **repaired by the [Mortician](obelisks#mortician)** for the small fee of a Gold Ingot.

## ![Soul Vessel](img/soul_vessel.png)Empty Soul Vessel

Once repaired, Soul Vessels can be used to **remove the soul** of most mobs,
excluding bosses and soulless mobs. Without soul, the mobs will become empty hulls
which can be **possessed by remnant players**.

The process of removing a soul can fail however - in case of which the Soul Vessel shatters and
your level of Attrition increases - and its chance of success depends on the player's level of Attrition,
the target's strength, health, max health, base armor, armor toughness as well as, despite being rare,
innate soul defense.

**You can _not_ start a soul removal if your Attrition level is 4.**

### ![Filled Soul Vessel](img/soul_vessel_filled.png)Filled Soul Vessel

Once a Soul Vessel is filled it can either be used for **trading with the Mortician**,
or the Soul **can be released** again, in case of which it will return to the original mob
it was removed from, reviving said mob. If that mob is dead, the Soul will collapse upon release.
