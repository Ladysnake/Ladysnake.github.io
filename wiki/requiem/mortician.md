## Mortician

The Mortician is a dead Piglin Trader selling items that are crucial to remnant gameplay such as [Soul Vessels](soul-vessels#empty-soul-vessel). Their prices usually include a **base item** and some **Gold Ingots**, a fee for the processing of the base item. 

By default, Morticians won't attack but once provoked they will **remove souls** from mobs and **curse the player** with [**Penance**](effects#penance) in order to defend themselves.

If you manage to kill a Mortician, it will always drop a **Soul Vessel**.

### Trades

#### Conversion Trade

Using this trade as a mortal player allows you to obtain a [**Sealed Remnant Vessel**](soul-vessels#sealed-remnant-vessel) for **1 Netherite Ingot** and **32 Gold Ingots**, which, upon using, will release the remnant caught inside and change your **Soul Type to remnant**.

Remnants will be able to bring a [**Soul Vessel**](soul-vessels#empty-soul-vessel) as well as a **Netherite Ingot** to the Mortician in order to let it trap their remnant inside the Soul Vessel, **turning them back to a mortal**.
