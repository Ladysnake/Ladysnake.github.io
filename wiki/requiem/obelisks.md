# Obelisks

Obelisks are **player-built structures** usually **casting [Soul Effects]()** on nearby remnant players. Their function depends on the **Runestones** used and they absorb the power of the souls trapped in Soul Sand and Soul Soil.

### Structure

The Obelisk's **core** is made of different **Runestones**, having a **maximal width of 5 blocks** and a **maximal height of 20 blocks**.

The core is encased in a **frame** of **Tachylite blocks** as seen in the picture below.

An Obelisk also requires **Soul Sand or Soul Soil** in order to **power** up with **increasing needs as the size of the Obelisk is expanded**. Soul Sand and Soul Soil must be placed **below** the Obelisk with a clear **line of sight** in between block and structure. The valid area to place your Soul blocks is a square with the side length `10*width of the core` with the Obelisk in its center.

An Obelisk will effect remnant players in a square shaped area of `10*width of the obelisk+10` blocks radius.

### Runestones

#### Tachylite Runestones

Tachylite Runestones are the **defining factor** of an Obelisk. The basic Tachylite Runestones can be crafted using 8 Tachylite and 1 Crying Obsidian.

Tachylite Runestones can then be **imbued using [Ichors]()** and will adopt the respective **[Soul Effect]()**. Once they are imbued they can not be changed but will **grant their Soul Effect** to remnant players once included in an Obelisk.

#### Soul Rift

The Soul Rift can be crafted using 4 Tachylite Runestones, 4 Crying Obisian and 1 Enderpearl. They will allow **dissociated remnant players** to **teleport** between different Soul Rifts as long as they **do not have Attrition IV**. Rifts will also **increase the level of Attrition** upon teleport.

Soul Rifts will also have the side effect of attracting **Ethereal Morticians** to roam around the Obelisk.

### Tachylite

Tachylite is the base material for Obelisks.

\- Recipe

#### Derelict Tachylite

(Drops large amounts of Xp and 0.2 + 0.1 * fortune chance on shattered Soul Vessel)

\- Strength is halfway in between Obsidian and Basalt

*-* *Tachylite block family??*

### Derelict Obelisks

Derelict Obelisks are **abandoned structures** spawning in **Soul Sand Valleys**. They include **Derelict Tachylite** and are therefore a source of [Soul Vessels](). They also have a 1 in 3 chance to have a **Mortician** roaming the area.

## Mortician

\- Soul-stealing attack on non-players

\- Different look if rift-spawned

\- Special trade turning remnants into normal players

\- Curses Players with Penance if provoked

Naturally spawned morticians now drop empty soul vessels on death

### Ethereal Mortician
