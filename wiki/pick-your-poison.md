## Poison Dart Frogs

Poison Dart Frogs can be found spawning in 7 different types in the **various jungle variants**. They can be **picked up by using a bowl** on them and will give the player their **respective effect when hit or licked**.

Licking a Poison Dart Frog can be done by **"eating" the picked up version** and will not consume the frog. You can **not lick** a Poison Dart Frog **while you have its effect** and the frogs themselves are immune to their effects.

Putting a picked up Poison Dart Frog back down requires **sneaking while right-clicking**.



### Advancements

Pick Your Poison features 2 special advancements:

- **Taste Test** - Lick a poison dart frog in a bowl

### Poison Dart Frog types

#### ![Blue Poison Dart Frog](pick-your-poison/blue_poison_dart_frog_bowl.png) Blue

Blue Poison Dart Frogs give the **Comatose** effect for **20 seconds**.

##### Comatose

Comatose **renders the player unable to see or do anything**, including pausing the game or opening the inventory **until the effect runs out or the player is attacked**. Being a regenerative sleep however, Comatose will cause the player to **gain back some health** while under the effect. Additionally, the **first damage** received by a comatosed player **will be negated**.

#### ![Golden Poison Dart Frog](pick-your-poison/golden_poison_dart_frog_bowl.png) Golden 

Golden Poison Dart Frogs will apply the **Batrachotoxin** effect for **30 seconds**.

##### Batrachotoxin

Batrachotoxin is a **stronger version of the vanilla poison, ignoring armor enchantments** such as protection.

#### ![Green Poison Dart Frog](pick-your-poison/green_poison_dart_frog_bowl.png) Green

Green Poison Dart Frogs apply the **Numbness** effect for **20 seconds**.

##### Numbness

Numbness **prevents the player from taking any damage** while the effect lasts. Instead, **the damage is applied all at once as soon as the effect runs out**. This cannot be bypassed using milk or commands.

Orange Poison Dart Frogs will give the **Vulnerability** effect for **30 seconds**.

#### ![Crimson Poison Dart Frog](pick-your-poison/crimson_poison_dart_frog_bowl.png) Crimson

Crimson Poison Dart Frogs give the **Torpor** effect for **30 seconds**.

##### Torpor

Torpor **blocks all health regeneration** but slowly **refills the hunger bar** while the effect lasts.

#### ![Red Poison Dart Frog](pick-your-poison/red_poison_dart_frog_bowl.png) Red

Red Poison Dart Frogs will apply the **Stimulation** effect for **20 seconds**.

##### Stimulation

Stimulation gives a **speed boost and removes the limit of only being able to sprint with 3 or more hunger points**. Instead, losing hunger while having the Stimulation effect will result in taking damage. **Players will take 1 heart of damage each time half a hunger point is lost.**

![Stimulation effect](pick-your-poison/stimulation.png)



#### ![Luxalamander](pick-your-poison/luxalamander_bowl.png) Luxalamander

The Luxalamander is a rare frog type appearing only **once in 100 spawns** and referencing the main texture artist for this mod, **Luxintrus**. Licking or hitting this Poison Dart Frog will anger it into punching your eyes and inflict **Blindness for 1 minute**. For some mysterious reason, the Blindness effect can also be applied to a [poison dart](#poison-darts).



#### ![Rana Frog](pick-your-poison/rana_bowl.png) Rana Frog

The Rana Frog is a special frog type only obtainable by **renaming another Poison Dart Frog to "Rana"** using a Name Tag. It does **not have a poison** and **no Throwing Darts** can be coated using this frog. Also note it can not be converted back to a normal Poison Dart Frog.



## Throwing Darts

Throwing Darts can be **crafted in a bunch of 4 using 1 Iron Nugget, 1 Bamboo and 1 Feather**. They can be stacked and thrown by hand, **dealing as much damage and knockback as a fist punch**. When used on a placed down frog they will be **imbued with the respective poison**, applying it to hit targets for a few seconds. Imbued Poison Darts are not stackable.
